Autonomous Security Agent (ASA)
An intelligent, multi-agent AI system for real-time cybersecurity threat detection, response, and reporting — powered by Reinforcement Learning, LLMs, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

🔍 About the Project
Modern cybersecurity threats evolve faster than static rule-based systems can handle. ASA is designed to autonomously:

Monitor network traffic for anomalies

Classify threats using deep reinforcement learning

Generate human-readable incident reports using LLMs

Retrieve and reference real CVE data via RAG

Orchestrate these actions using a modular multi-agent architecture

This repo isn’t just another AI demo — it's a practical, extensible cybersecurity agent framework that can be applied to real-world SOC pipelines, honeypots, and red-team/blue-team simulation tools.

🧭 Use Cases
✅ Real-time SOC (Security Operations Center) augmentation

✅ Simulated environments for red-team training

✅ Autonomous CVE analysis & patch suggestion

✅ XAI (Explainable AI) for threat classification

🧠 Core Architecture
This system is built on a modular multi-agent design where each agent performs a specialized function and communicates asynchronously through an orchestrator.

Agent Roles:
Agent	Description
DetectorAgent	Uses Reinforcement Learning to identify threat patterns from log or packet data
ReportAgent	Uses GPT-4 to generate incident summaries and remediation suggestions
ResponseAgent	Makes decisions on mitigation (e.g. isolate IP, throttle service)
CVEAgent	Performs RAG from live CVE databases to enrich incident context

🧰 Tech Stack
Category	Tools & Frameworks
AI/ML	PyTorch, RLlib, OpenAI GPT-4, Hugging Face Transformers
RAG	LangChain, Pinecone/FAISS, NVD/CVE APIs
Backend	Python FastAPI, Docker, Redis (for agent communication)
Data	CICIDS2017, NSL-KDD, Simulated attack streams
Observability	Prometheus, Grafana (optional for log metrics)

⚙️ Installation & Quick Start
Prerequisites
Python 3.10+

Docker (optional for isolation)

OpenAI API key (for GPT-4 agent)

ElasticSearch (if using full RAG mode)

🚀 Spin It Up Locally
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/autonomous-security-agent.git
cd autonomous-security-agent

# Set up virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Add OpenAI key
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here

# Run the orchestrator
python run.py
🧪 Try It Out
bash
Copy
Edit
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/ingest-log \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"log": "Suspicious outbound connection on port 8080..."}'
✅ You’ll receive:

Threat classification ("high")

Explanation from GPT-4

Recommended actions ("block IP, notify admin")

Referenced CVE (CVE-2023-xxxxx)

🛠 How It Works
Reinforcement Learning Agent (Detector)
Trained on CICIDS logs using RLlib

Learns temporal and multi-feature patterns

Can adapt to novel or zero-day threats

LLM Agent (Report)
Generates human-readable incident summaries

Formats in JSON/Markdown

References CVE descriptions via RAG

RAG Pipeline
Queries real-time CVE databases (via NVD API or local snapshot)

Uses vector embedding + FAISS or Pinecone

Matches threat characteristics to known exploits

📈 Roadmap

🙋‍♀️ FAQ
Why not just use a SIEM tool?
Because those don’t write explanations in perfect English or adapt on the fly using RL.

Does this work on live traffic?
With packet parsing modules and real-time ingestion — yes. Default is log-based.

Is this safe for production?
Still experimental. Don’t let the ResponseAgent control your firewall in prod… yet.
